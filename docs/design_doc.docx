  - Customizable player ball appearances (colors, patterns, and skins).

- **Audio:**
  - Each racetrack has a different audio theme.
  - Audio affects ball speed; the ball moves faster during fast audio sections.

#### **5. Game Modes**

- **King of the Balls:**
  - Tournament with 5-6 rounds (normal + 1 bonus final).
  - 4-8 players can play at a time.
  - Leaderboard maintained, and the top 3 finalists play the final round.
  - If final scores are tied, the winners can vote to play another round. 
  - In case players decide not to play next round, all players tied at number position will be termed winners.

- **Casual Multiplayer:**
  - 2-8 players compete on any random track.

- **Relay Race:**
  - 2 teams of 2-4 members participate in 4-5 rounds.
  - Goal is to reach the end of the last round before the other team. 
  - Teammate from the previous round must reach the finish line of the previous round before teammate of current round can start the current round.
  - A tag animation will play out when a teammates tag and the next round begins immediately. 

- **Chill Mode:**
  - A calmer, relaxed mode where the objective is to determine the color of your ball as quickly as possible.
  - 4-8 players are assigned randomly colored balls. Each ball starts at the (0,0) position of a mesh grid. Players can move to adjacent positions.
  - If two balls are at the same position, the grid point color turns black. When only one ball is present, its color is revealed.
  - 5-10 games are played, with cumulative scores determining the final winner.
